## What does the RDMkit aim to achieve?
More than ever, scientists need relevant tools and guidance to better manage their data and hence contribute to making FAIR Science a reality as well as help researchers be more productive for themselves and their collaborators.

- **For researchers** - RDMkit is a one stop shop of information, advice and signposting to research data management know-how, tools, examples and best practice. Struggling with writing your project data management plan? Then RDMkit can help.

- **For data managers in laboratories, facilities or universities** - RDMkit is a resource for your researchers, a complement to your own resources and a guide to the specific challenges of RDM for life science researchers. 

- **For funding agencies and policy makers** - RDMkit is the resource researchers can turn to at the proposal stage of the research, throughout their projects and when publishing their results.  Remember that the cost of not having FAIR research data has been estimated at 10.2bn annually in Europe. By using RDMkit and better managing  data, the outcomes of your investments will be contributing to strengthening regional, national and European economies.
