## Who is the RDMkit for?
The ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit) has been designed to guide life scientists in their efforts to better manage their research data following the FAIR Principles. It is based on the various steps of the data lifecycle, although not all the steps will be relevant to everyone.

The contents are generated and maintained by the ELIXIR community. More information on how we want to sustain and govern RDMkit can be found on the [RDMkit Alliance page](rdmkit_alliance).

## Why are the FAIR principles needed?
At the heart of FAIR Science lies good data management practice. This is increasingly important as life science research becomes data-intensive and traditional 'wet labs' make space for 'dry (computer) labs'.

With that in mind, the [FAIR Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) were designed to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of research data. The intention of these principles is to improve the **F**indability, **A**ccessibility, **I**nteroperability and **R**euse of digital assets.

The increasing volume, complexity and speed of data creation made scientists rely on computational support exponentially. Therefore, the FAIR Principles place specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use data, as well as supporting its reuse by other scientists, which facilitates knowledge discovery and improves research transparency.
